(1) How to setup and run

$ Copy main.cpp in the repository and paste the code to Mbed studio.
$ Construct the circuit, including the wires, resistors and capacitor on the bread board.
$ Set up Picoscope and conect it to your PC.
$ Run the program in Mbed and close Mbed studio.
$ Copy FFT1.py in the repository and paste to Visual code.
$ Run Visual code and select frequency to generate waveform, and wait for the result.

(2) Results

$ The button on the left switches the frequency up, whereas the middle button switches the freqency down. The button on the right is the select button.
$ After you select the frequency, the terminal will show your current frequency.
$ After selecting, check out Picoscope for the result. There will be a trapezoidal wave in the frequency you selected.
$ There should be a figure jumping out, showing the FFT of the wave you have selected.
